During my internship at Inxee Systems Private Limited, I worked as a web service development intern and contributed to building an Inventory Management System using PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and MySQL (XAMPP). My primary focus was on the website part of the system, where I played a crucial role in creating the login and logout forms for the users.

One of the key functionalities I worked on was adding users to the system as employees and providing them with unique user IDs and passwords for accessing the Inventory Management System. To accomplish this, I designed and implemented the necessary database structure using MySQL on PHPMyAdmin (XAMPP).

Through my efforts, I successfully integrated user management into the system, allowing administrators to add new employees and assign them appropriate access credentials. By doing so, I contributed to enhancing the system's security and ensuring that only authorized personnel could access the inventory management features.

Overall, my contributions as a part of the development team played a crucial role in shaping the Inventory Management System, enabling efficient management of inventory and improving the company's internal processes. Through this experience, I honed my skills in web development, database management, and team collaboration, which will undoubtedly be valuable assets in my future career endeavors.
